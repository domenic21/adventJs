/*GitHub Copilot: The selected JavaScript code defines a function named `manufacture` 
that takes two arguments: `gifts` and `materials`. This function is designed to filter an array of gifts
 based on the materials available.

The `RegExp` constructor is used to create a new regular expression object. 
The regular expression is constructed using a template string that starts with `^`, ends with `$`, and contains the `materials` in between. The `^` symbol in a regular expression indicates the start of a line, while the `$` symbol indicates the end of a line. 
This means that the regular expression will match any string that starts and ends with the characters in `materials`.

The `filter` method is then called on the `gifts` array. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. 
In this case, the test is the `regex.test` method, which is bound to the `regex` object using the `bind` method. The `test` method of a regular expression object executes 
a search for a match between the regular expression and a 
specified string, returning `true` if a match is found and `false` otherwise.

In summary, the `manufacture` function filters the `gifts` array to include only those elements that consist entirely of characters found in the `materials` string.*/
